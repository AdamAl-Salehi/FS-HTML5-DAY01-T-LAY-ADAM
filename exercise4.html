	<p>I'm going back to 505</p>
	<p>if its a seven hour flight or a fourty five minute drive</p>
	<p>In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side</p>
	<p>With your hands between your thighs</p>
	<p>Stop and wait a sec</p>
	<p>Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling</p>
	<p>What did you expect?</p>
	<p>I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck</p>
	<p>Or I did last time I checked</p>
